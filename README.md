# Desktop tips and tricks

This page is for everybody working with a desktop computer. If you are a software developer, then please have a look at [my guidelines](https://github.com/guettli/programming-guidelines)

Although mobile interfaces are very important. I prefer a desktop PC/Laptop for daily **work**. In spare time I use my mobile phone more than my desktop PC/Laptop.

## Monitor
reduce brightness. I most cases the screen is too bright.

## Copy+Paste History

A clipboard manager is a great tool. Don't ask me why only a few people use one.

[CopyQ](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ) work on Linux, Windows, Mac.

## Chrome 

### Shortcuts

https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179

* Ctrl + t: new tab. Then autocomplete in address bar.
* Ctrl + Shift + t: Reopen previously closed tabs in the order they were closed
* Ctrl + number-of-tab: Jump to numbered tab
* Ctrl + f: Open the Find Bar to search the current page    
* Ctrl + Shift + j: Open Developer Tools    
* F11: Turn full-screen mode on or off    
* Ctrl and +: Make everything on the page bigger    
* Ctrl-l: Jump to the address bar (for searching a term or going to a previous page)

The third (pinned) tab is the mail app. I can start to compose a new mail with ctr + 3, "c".


### Native GUI vs Chrome

Native GUI? No, if I want to work from a different device, then I don't have the files from the local drive. Yes, I could sync them, but for me in the browser (Software as a Service) is easier.  

### Pinned Tabs

From right to left: Calendar, Chat, Mail, Docs, Translator

### Long press back button

History: The title says a lot (for example in Gmail: Access one of the last mails)

### Bookmarks are dead, autocomplete in the address bar is king

I need to open a lot of different tools daily. In the past I used bookmarks, but this does not make
sense any more.

The autocomplete in the chrome address bar is fine. You just need to remember some part of the URL or 
the title of the page you want to open.

### Chrome Extensions

#### Chrome Extension "Quick Tabs"

[Quick Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb): A keyboard centric most recently used (MRU) ordered tab list plugin with search and switch functionality (inspired by IntelliJ IDEA). On Linux you can map the short-cut to ctrl-e (like in PyCharm) via [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts). See [issue 305](https://github.com/babyman/quick-tabs-chrome-extension/issues/305)

Option "Keep last searched string in search box". I guess you want this to be "off". Right-click on icon right to the chrome address bar. Then Options, then "Keep last searched string in search box".

Option "Jump to previous tab on close of any tab (Tip: use to close tabs in reverse order, aka. undo your mess)" is handy. Usually you press ctrl-t to open a new tab. Then you do you work in this tab. If you close this tab (for example with ctrl-w), then you get back to the tab which had the focus before you pressed ctrl-t. That's the most obvious thing, and I don't understand why this is not the default of chrome.

### One laptop, two chrome profiles (personal, business)

See profile image right to the URL in chrome.

## Slack

* Action on message: Remind me about this ... tomorrow.
* Direct Messages / Slackbot. n-days-later-method works. Nice
* Shortcuts: https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts
* Some of my questions which are not solved yet: [webapps.stackexchange.com user:guettli [slack]](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A95624+%5Bslack%5D)

Goal: Use the chat without touching the mouse. Shortcuts I use:
* F6: moves to the next section
* Alt-left-arrow, Alt-right-arrow: move

### Slack: Focused walk through the last messages in "Threads".

* Click on "Threads" (upper left corner)
* Press TAB until the latest (upper) message in "Threads" gets highlighted with a blue box.
* Now you can press arrow-down/up to walk through the messages step-by-step.

I prefer this to scrolling, since the blue box helps you to keep the focus.

## Gmail

* Snooze
* [Simple gmail notes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-gmail-notes/jfjkcbkgjohminidbpendlodpfacgmlm)

## Google Drive

* Search: "title:foo" or via â–¼

## Open particular document

How I find/open a particular document the fastest way (in my case a google doc in gdrive)? I type the word of the title of the doc into the address bar of chrome.

For example, things which annoy me are in the doc called "grrrr" - my digital barf bag. It is opened very fast: ctrl-t (open new tab in the browser), then "grr" and then it is one of the results below the cursor. I love it.



## Typing with ten fingers

It makes typing much easier.

## Keyboard

I love the Lenovo track point with extra grip.

## Preparation for the daily standup meeting

I write into the calendar the things I worked on. This way it is easy to talk about the past day in the daily stand-up meeting (scrum).

## Taking Screenshots (Mac)

* Doc: Screenshot / Options / **Clipboard**
* Press and hold these three keys together: Shift, Command, and 4 https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361

## Anonymizing Screenshots (and other images)

* Gimp

## Drawing on Screenshots

* https://szoter.com/launch/ Very simple user interface. I like it.
* With Gimp
* With google slides: Put screenshot in the background. Benefit: Lines/Text etc can get changed later again.
* Google drawing: https://docs.google.com/drawings/
