# Desktop tips and tricks

This page is for everybody. If you are a software developer, then please have a look at [my guidelines](https://github.com/guettli/programming-guidelines)

## Copy+Paste History
diodon on Linux, CopyQ on Windows, TODO on Mac.

## Chrome 

### Pinned Tabs

From right to left: Calendar, Chat, Mail, Docs, Translator

### Long press back button

History: The title says a lot (for example in gmail: Access one of the last mails)

## Slack

* Action on message: Remind be about this ... tomorrow.
* Direct Messages / Slackbot. n-days-later-method works. Nice

## GMail

* Snooze
* [Simple gmail notes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-gmail-notes/jfjkcbkgjohminidbpendlodpfacgmlm)

## Typing with ten fingers
It makes typing much easier

## Keyboard

I love the Lenovo track point with extra grip.

## Preparation for daily standup meeting

I write into the calendar the things I worked on. This way it is easy to talk about the past day in the daily stand-up meeting (scrum).
