# Desktop tips and tricks

This page is for everybody. If you are a software developer, then please have a look at [my guidelines](https://github.com/guettli/programming-guidelines)

## Monitor
reduce brightness. I most cases the screen is too bright.

## Copy+Paste History

A clipboard manager is a great tool. Don't ask my why only few people is one.

[CopyQ](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ) work on Linux, Windows, Mac.

## Chrome 

### Native GUI vs Chrome

Native GUI? No, if I want to work from a different device, then I don't have the files from the local drive. Yes, I could sync them, but for me in browser (Software as a Service) is easier.  

### Pinned Tabs

From right to left: Calendar, Chat, Mail, Docs, Translator

### Long press back button

History: The title says a lot (for example in gmail: Access one of the last mails)

### One laptop, two chrome profiles (personal, business)

See profile image right to the URL in chrome.

## Slack

* Action on message: Remind be about this ... tomorrow.
* Direct Messages / Slackbot. n-days-later-method works. Nice
* Shortcuts: https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts

## GMail

* Snooze
* [Simple gmail notes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-gmail-notes/jfjkcbkgjohminidbpendlodpfacgmlm)

## Typing with ten fingers
It makes typing much easier

## Keyboard

I love the Lenovo track point with extra grip.

## Preparation for daily standup meeting

I write into the calendar the things I worked on. This way it is easy to talk about the past day in the daily stand-up meeting (scrum).

## Paint on Screenshots

With google slides.
